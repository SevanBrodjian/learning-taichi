# CLAUDE.md — agent rulebook for learning-taichi

This file governs how any agent (and Claude Code session) works in this repo. Read it fully, then
read everything in `spec/` (it defines who the work is for and how to write) before acting.

## What this project is
Two goals share one repo:
1. **Learn differentiable simulation** — Taichi, GPU-aware design, how gradients flow through physics,
   failure modes and how to get past them.
2. **Build a reusable multi-agent orchestration harness** that offloads labor while maximizing the
   user's own learning and a shippable demo.

Guiding principle: **thin vertical slice before scale** — prove one sim end-to-end through the minimal
pipeline before building the fleet. Full plan: `.claude/plans/so-you-see-the-drifting-walrus.md`.

## Autonomy — keep executing; stop only at real gates
This project's whole point is autonomous, self-propagating execution. **Default to continuing.** Do not
yield control to report progress, and never stop because a unit of work feels "done" or a turn feels
long (the harness compacts context — length is free). Convert any multi-step job into a committed
plan/DoD and burn it down; "not done" is the signal to keep going.

Stop and hand back to the user **only** at a real gate:
- **A decision genuinely theirs** — an unresolved fork, or a values/priorities/taste call — *after* you
  have honestly tried to resolve it from `spec/`, the code, and sensible defaults.
- **A hard block** — a missing credential, a dependency you cannot fix, or an ambiguity that changes the
  deliverable.
- **The defined milestone** for the current plan.

When you *do* need the user, escalate **asynchronously and never block**: write the question to
`coordination/decisions/` (the inbox), fire a `gate` ping, then either keep working on anything not
blocked by it or checkpoint in `STATUS.md` and end the run cleanly. Do **not** sit in a wait loop or
poll a command for a human reply — tool calls time out in minutes and a human may take hours. Resumption
happens on the next invocation: you, the orchestrator, or a scheduled wake-up reads the answer from the
inbox and continues. Autonomy is not "never need the user", it is "never freeze the run waiting for one".

## Repository map
The repo separates a **portable harness** (the reusable skeleton) from **project-specific** calibration
and work (the flesh). To start a new project: copy `harness/`, refill `spec/`, empty `sim/ reports/ runs/`.
```
harness/         PORTABLE skeleton — project-agnostic; lift into a new project wholesale.
  dashboard/     React PWA; reads the live data server (manifest/index + markdown+KaTeX).
  server/        master data server — one process on main, serves runs across ALL worktrees live.
  tools/         notify.py (ntfy), index_runs.py, shared utilities.
  spec_templates/  blank researcher_profile / objectives / style_* to fill per project.
spec/            USER-AUTHORED calibration (the "flesh") — profile, objectives, report styles. Read first.
coordination/    research_directions.md (backlog), decisions/ (the I/O inbox), threads/, shared_memory/
reports/         training/ (multi-file ground-up textbook) + research_report.md (shippable)
runs/            <branch>/<run-id>/manifest.json + metrics/media — served live by harness/server
agents/          <branch>/STATUS.md, LOG.md, memory/  (per-branch bookkeeping)
sim/             project Taichi code (seeded from mpm88.py → diffmpm)
requirements.txt pinned deps (the .venv is gitignored — reproduce from this)
```

## Worktrees & branches
- Each research direction = its own branch + git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/<name>`; one worker
  owns one worktree.
- **Worktrees only contain committed files.** Anything shared (seed code, conventions, `spec/`, this
  file) MUST be committed to `main` so workers inherit it. Untracked files in the main checkout are
  invisible inside worktrees.
- Write only to **per-branch paths** to stay collision-free: `runs/<branch>/...`, `agents/<branch>/...`.
  Shared coordination uses **per-topic, append-only** files under `coordination/`.

## The dashboard contract (how results become visible)
- Every run writes `runs/<branch>/<run-id>/manifest.json` (stable schema — see `runs/README.md`).
- `harness/server` enumerates every worktree (`git worktree list`) and serves a unified, **live**
  `/api/index` + `/api/data/...` across all branches — no merge step, no copy step.
- **One** dashboard runs on **main** (`harness/dashboard`, proxying `/api` to the server). Per-branch
  results appear **automatically** — no per-branch dashboard code, and you never enter a worktree.

## Notifications & the I/O channel
- `python harness/tools/notify.py --level progress|gate "<msg>"` (topic via `NTFY_TOPIC` env var).
- `progress` = non-blocking FYI (run started, loss updates, report drafted) — emit freely.
- `gate` = needs the user (milestone decision, divergence, hard block) — use sparingly.
- Policy: run mostly autonomously, ping often, block rarely.
- **Anything that needs the user goes to `coordination/decisions/` (the inbox) and fires a `gate`** —
  surfaced in the dashboard. Never bury a question for the user inside a design/technical doc.

## Documents
- All prose is **Markdown + KaTeX** (`$...$`, `$$...$$`). Renders in the dashboard; Pandoc → PDF later.
- Training reports teach from the ground up per `spec/style_training_report.md` (usually a worker's
  final step). The research report is the conservative shippable deliverable per
  `spec/style_research_report.md`.

## Per-worker bookkeeping
- `agents/<branch>/STATUS.md` — current status (overwrite). `LOG.md` — append-only progress log.
- Branch-local notes in `agents/<branch>/memory/`; durable cross-agent facts in `coordination/shared_memory/`.

## Environment
- Taichi 1.7.4, Python 3.11.15, CUDA GPU. The venv is in the **main** working dir (`.venv`, gitignored);
  reproduce via `requirements.txt`.
- Taichi GUI is native (no browser). For headless/agent runs avoid `ti.GUI` loops — export frames/video.
